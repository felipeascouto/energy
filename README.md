# Interpretable Machine Learning Models in the Context of Increasing Renewable Energy Generation

The purpose of this study is to develop interpretable machine learning models and analyze how supply and demand attributes correlate with price fluctuations. 
Optimal Regression Trees and Multiple Linear Regressions are applied to the Southwest Power Pool market data, shedding some light upon the attributes' sensitivities. 
By doing so, the study hopes to improve the understanding of the market and corroborate with the expansion of renewable energy generation and energy storage in the grid.

Deliverable notebook with polished models is the file IML-ESS-SPP.ipynb.

Other notebooks contain development work.
